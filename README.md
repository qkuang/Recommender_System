# Recommender_System

With the game data extracted through API from Steam website, I would like to apply different recommendation algorithm to this dataset. After comparing different algorithm, I would choose an optimal one or a hybrid one and achieve top recommended games to each user with the recommended method. 

This figure below shows the distribution of the initial price of games, and it indicates that there is 90% of games’ initial price is below $20, and 70% of games’ initial price is below $10.
